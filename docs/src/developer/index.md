# Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for the `miden` transport layer node :)

This is intended to serve as a basic introduction to the codebase as well as covering relevant concepts and recording
architectural decisions.

This is _not_ intended for dApp developers or users of the node, but for development of the node itself.

It is also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the [operator manual](../operator/index.md).

Living documents go stale - the code is the final arbitrator of truth.

If you encounter any outdated, incorrect or misleading information, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-private-transport/issues/new/choose).

Please also see the `miden-node` contribution [guidelines](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-node/developer/contributing.html) and monitoring [guide](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-node/developer/monitoring.html) as these also apply here.
