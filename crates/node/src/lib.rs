//! # Miden Transport Layer Client Library
//!
//! Implementation of the Miden Transport Layer node for private notes.
//!
//! The implementation is focused on performance and privacy.
//! Only (optionally-encrypted) notes are stored.
//!
//! Features include,
//! - sending and receiving notes;
//! - streaming of notes;
//! - note persistence using proven-databases and respective maintenance;
//! - metrics and traces, exported through the OpenTelemetry framework for monitoring.
//!
//! ## Database
//! Notes are stored in a database, implementing the
//! [`Database`](`crate::database::DatabaseBackend`). A SQLite-based  implementation is provided.
//!
//! ### Maintenance
//! A periodic task [`DatabaseMaintenance`](`crate::database::DatabaseMaintenance`) takes care of
//! maintaining the database (cleaning up older notes).
//!
//! ## Telemetry
//! Metrics and traces to monitor the node state are provided.
//! While metrics provide insights into general requests stats, traces can provide insights into
//! specific requests.
//! Metrics and traces can be exported following using the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) framework.
